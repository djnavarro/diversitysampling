- *diversitySampling.R* implements the Bayesian generalisation model under strong and weak sampling assumptions, generates random hypothesis spaces and then computes the relationship between premise diversity and the strength of evidence for a superordinate category.
- *diversityData.Rdata* saves the results of one such simulation
- *empiricalData.csv* is a set of averaged ratings from the experiments used in drawing the figures
- *figure.pdf* is the output
